# **Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python – EDHEC Implementation**  

This repository contains my implementation of key concepts from the *Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python* course by EDHEC Business School. The project focuses on portfolio optimization, risk management, and financial modeling using a structured, modular approach with minimal reliance on external libraries.  

## **Overview**  

This project applies various portfolio construction techniques, including:  

- **Returns and Risk Analysis** – Computing asset returns, statistical moments, drawdowns, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional VaR (CVaR).  
- **Portfolio Optimization** – Efficient Frontier, Equally Weighted Portfolio, Global Minimum Variance (GMV) Portfolio, and diversification limits.  
- **Dynamic Risk Management** – Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) and risk budgeting strategies (PSP & GHP).  
- **Stochastic Modeling & Simulations** – Random walk generation, Monte Carlo simulations, and present value calculations.  
- **Fixed-Income Modeling** – Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, cash vs. zero-coupon bonds, and Monte Carlo simulation of coupon-bearing bonds.  
- **Liability-Driven Investing (LDI)** – Strategies for managing liabilities alongside asset allocations.  
- **Modular Python Development** – Creating reusable functions and building a personal financial library with minimal dependencies.  

## **Technologies Used**  

This project uses minimal external libraries to maintain flexibility and deeper learning:  

- **Core Libraries**:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`  
  - `scipy`
